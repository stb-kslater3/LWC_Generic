    This component is for testing out the behavior of HTML, LWC, etc. to ensure we get the appropriate behavior for the generic LWC Interface. This is an arbitrary child where you can try different things out before implementing the actual component you want to make, and then adding that new component to the sandbox_parent's HTML.
